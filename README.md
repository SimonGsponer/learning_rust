# learning_rust
My journey to become a seasoned rust dev!


Useful commands:

```bash
# creates a new project
cargo new guessing_game
```

### Chapter 2

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
```

Cargo.lock should be included in source code repo if your create a library

```bash
# creates documentation locally
cargo doc --open
```
